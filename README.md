# Es6 Asynchronous Application
Using formula: E=E0cos(kx−ωt+ϕ) to calculate Electromagnetic Waves.
Where: E0  is the amplitude of the wave, k is the wave number, x is the position, ω is the angular frequency, t is the time, ϕ is the phase constant.

Asynchronous Components: 
1.	Calculate E 0  cos(ϕ) - the initial amplitude considering the phase. 
2.	Calculate kx - the wave number times the position. 
3.	Calculate ωt - the angular frequency times the time. 
4.	Subtract ωt from kx. 
5.	Add ϕ to the result of step 4. 
6.	Calculate the cosine of the result from step 5. 
7.	Multiply E0  by the result of step 6 to get E. 

Use of async/await, Promises, and encapsulate the operations within a class is used
